I am a Research Scientist at [IBM Research AI](https://www.research.ibm.com/) at the T.J. Watson Research Center in NY. 
I have been a member of the Multimodal Team in the [Foundations of Trusted AI Department](https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/trusted-ai/#) since 2015. With my colleagues, we work on Machine Learning for Mulitmodal systems. The list of posts below will show you the range of our research works.
