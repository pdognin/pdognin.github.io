I am a (Senior) Research Staff Member at [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/).
Over the years I worked on multiple topics starting with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), then on to Multimodal Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Computer Vision and Text).
This website presents some of my research work.
