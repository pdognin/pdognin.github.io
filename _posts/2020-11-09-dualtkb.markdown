DualTKB is a dual learning approach for unsupervised path-to-text and text-to-path generation where we reframe this transfer as a translation task  

This work will be presented at the EMNLP’20 Gather Session 5D “Information Extraction” on 11/18/2020 at 1pm (UTC-5) US East Coast Time

A [DualTKB short description](https://github.com/IBM/dualtkb#dualtkb) can be found on the companion [IBM DualTKB website](https://github.com/IBM/dualtkb). There, we will provide code, information about dataset, etc. over the next weeks.  
For more in depth information, a version of our EMNLP'20 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14660) is available on arXiv.
