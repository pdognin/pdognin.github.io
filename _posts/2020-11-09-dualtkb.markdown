DualTKB is a dual learning approach for unsupervised path to text and text path generation.
This work will be presented at EMNLP'20. In the mean time, our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14660) is on arXiv for more details.
We will provide code, information about dataset in the future on [IBM DualTKB website](https://github.com/IBM/dualtkb).
