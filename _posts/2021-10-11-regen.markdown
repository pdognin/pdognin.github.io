# ReGen Presentation at EMNLP'21!

Our Regen [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12472) is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12472).
It was chosen as Oral presentation. We also will be participating in the virtual poster presentation:

- Oral Presentation: Session “3E: Machine Learning for NLP 2” – Sun 07/11 3:15pm - 3:30pm
- Virtual Poster: Session V2 – Mon 08/11 12:30pm-2:30pm

We are now working on the [ReGen website](https://github.com/IBM/regen) and will be publishing code there.
