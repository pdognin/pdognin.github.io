## About

I have been at IBM Research since 2005 working on Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Computer Vision (CV) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Multimodal Learning combining modalities of speech, image, video and text has been the focus of my current work in bi-directional retrieval, image retrieval, captioning, etc.

Prior to that, I completed my PhD on August 2003. While a PhD candidate, I gained research experience at the Speech and Language Processing group at BBN Technologies from May 2000 till the completion of my PhD work.

Research interests include machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, statistical modeling, automatic speech recognition, noise robustness, and any exciting applications of scientific computing.
